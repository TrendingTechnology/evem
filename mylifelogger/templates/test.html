<h2>What is mylifelogger?</h2>
<p>My lifelogger is a simple command line application for sending reminders for events through email, like this email you are currently getting.</p>
<h1>How it works?</h1>
<p>User can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create new events</li>
<li>Set reminders for those events</li>
<li>Edit, delete and look at those events</li>
<li>It is designed such that if this script is run on the startup, it checks all events
and checks if there is any event which reminder date is today.</li>
<li>If so it sends an HTML email as reminder</li>
</ul>
